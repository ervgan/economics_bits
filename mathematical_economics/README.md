## Project name
### A small research project between mathematics and economics

## Description
The goal of this project is to characterize wi(t), the optimal proportion invested in each risky asset and C(t), the optimal consumption of the agent seeking to maximize her intertemporal expected utility of consumption and terminal wealth under a budget constraint and with a stochastic investment opportunity set. Here, this set is introduced by the stochastic wage rate that will affect asset prices and thus wealth.
