# Quantitative risk management / University of Geneva

## Project name
### A small project creating an investment fund focused on non-linear risk

## Description
The mean-variance optimization problem leads to sub-optimal results when using the standard sample-based variance-covariance matrix. For this project, we consider the non-linear dependence between assets in the portfolio and we introduce a new restriction in the optimization problem. This will reduce the left-tail dependence leading to better risk-adjusted performance than the benchmark portfolio.
