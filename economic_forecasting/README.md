## Project name
### Autralian labour force forecast

## Description
We aim to find the best forecasting model for the Australian labour force which is the number of individuals in Australia who are able to work. The forecasts include forecast for all the months from September 2016 to August 2017 and density forecasts for the same months. We use a random walk as the benchmark model and we compare AR models on first difference, Holt-Winters smoothing model, and models using seasonality effects and predictors.
